# Advent of Code 2022 ðŸŽ‰

### ðŸŽ„ I joined the Advent of Code challenge <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2022">this year</a> to test my coding skills and have some fun along the way. 

- ðŸ’¡ I initially chose to tackle the problems using Haskell because I thought it would be a nice, challenging way to think about the problems in a functional way.

- ðŸ¤” However, as the puzzles got harder, I realized that my Haskell knowledge was limited, so I decided to switch over to the safe spot of Python.

- ðŸ˜ž Unfortunately, even with Python, some of the puzzles proved to be quite difficult, with strange inputs to parse and complex algorithms to implement. As a result, I ended up skipping a few days of the challenge.

### Merry Christmas! ðŸŽ…ðŸŽ„
